In this project, the dataset of New York City 311 calls is explored and analyzed using Hive, a powerful data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. The dataset provides valuable information about the various complaints and 
service requests received by the city's 311 call center. By leveraging the capabilities of Hive, the data set is loaded into a table, and a thorough analysis is done to gain meaningful insights.
The purpose of this report is to present our findings and offer recommendations to the Mayor of New York based on our analysis. While the appendices will provide detailed documentation of the Hive setup and queries, the primary focus of 
the report will be on the actionable recommendations derived from our analysis.
To effectively convey our findings, tables, graphs, and other visualizations are utilized aiming to persuade the mayor to take necessary actions based on the insights. By presenting compelling visual representations along with recommendations,
to create a persuasive case for the proposed changes that New York City should consider for its own betterment.
